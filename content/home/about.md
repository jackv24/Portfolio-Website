# About Me

I am a games programmer specializing in C# and Unity, and a graduate of the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Adelaide, South Australia.

Many of my game projects utilize many advanced features such as custom shaders, multiplayer networking, and editor scripting. I am also well-versed in Unity's 2D and UI features.

I have experience in C++, creating AI simulations, networked games, and using OpenGL to create a custom graphics engine.
